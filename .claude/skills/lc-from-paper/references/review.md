# REVIEW — close-out in the user's main session

The reproduction has converged: the constitution's `status:` is `closed` (after COMPARE returned `pass`, or `partial` with the un-acted opportunities logged, and the next cold-survey iteration found nothing left to do). The ralph loop's tmux session has exited. REVIEW runs back in the user's main session — the second of two interactive bookends, the first being ORIENT. It runs in the user's main session (not as an iteration) because both `/figure-comparison` and `/check-sentence-by-sentence` are interactive — they prompt the user for anything they can't infer, which doesn't work inside detached ralph iterations.

Its job is to render the validation surfaces, walk the user through the accumulated open questions, land the resolutions, and draft the final report — in one interactive arc. The Open opportunities list in CLAUDE.md already carries un-acted-on opportunities from the latest COMPARE (those iterations logged them directly); REVIEW just reads them.

The phase name **REVIEW** is freed by the old pre-implement REVIEW phase folding into ARCHITECT, SPECIFY, LITERATURE, and IMPLEMENT as their per-iteration self-review passes. This close-out is what the previous shape called SUMMARIZE_RUN.

## Inputs

- `astra.yaml` — final spec (validates with `--verify-evidence` once LITERATURE has resolved every `prior_insights:` placeholder's Evidence `quote:` selector)
- `comparison-report.yaml`, `comparison-report.md` — final verdict + opportunity assessment
- `targets/targets.md` — what was being matched against; reference figures / tables in `targets/`
- `results/<universe>/<output_id>/` — reproduced figures / tables / metrics
- `open-questions.md` at the workdir root — running report from the iteration-phases (paper-vs-code conflicts, ambiguities, anything iterations flagged for user resolution)
- `work/reference/index.json` and `work/reference/code-index.md` — for context
- `work/reference/source/` (Path A) or `work/reference/document.md` (Path B) and `work/reference/code/` — directly available for follow-up questions the user asks during REVIEW that the report and CLAUDE.md don't answer ("remind me what the paper says about X", "did the original code do Y"). Grep into for specifics; read targeted spans by offset/limit.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the workdir root — paper identity, Rules, Paper-vs-code disagreements, Open opportunities (the durable surface, accumulated across iterations)
- `constitution.md` at the workdir root — Goal, Fidelity intent, Scope, Quality bar, Evidence, Open dimensions (the driving document the loop has been working against)

## Outputs

- `.lightcone/comparison.html` — `/figure-comparison`'s portable side-by-side report (paper artifacts vs reproduced)
- (Optional) `/check-sentence-by-sentence`'s claim audit, rendered in-chat (file:line or NOT FOUND per sentence — the skill writes no files)
- `open-questions.md` — same file, but with `## Resolutions` section appended capturing what the user said for each entry
- Edits to `astra.yaml` / `implementation-notes.md` / `universes/baseline.yaml` if any open-question resolution warrants a spec change
- `REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md` — final report; concise (~1–2 pages); the canonical record of what the reproduction landed on
- CLAUDE.md updates — **Paper-vs-code disagreements** entries reconciled with their resolutions (Open opportunities already there from COMPARE iterations)
- A commit closing out the reproduction

## Step 1: render the validation surfaces

### `/figure-comparison` (mandatory)

Invoke the `/figure-comparison` skill from the user's main session. It builds a portable HTML side-by-side comparing paper artifacts (from `targets/`) to reproduced artifacts (from `results/<universe>/`). The skill asks the user about any inputs it can't infer from the workdir; that works because REVIEW runs back in the user's main session — the prompts land here, not in a detached iteration.

Output lands at `.lightcone/comparison.html`. Show the user the path and offer to open it (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, or just print the path so they click in their terminal).

**Do not spawn `/figure-comparison` under the `Task` tool or inside a ralph iteration.** It prompts the user for inputs it can't infer; sub-agents and detached iterations have no user-reach, so the prompt fires into nothing.

### `/check-sentence-by-sentence` (opt-in)

Ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether they want the claim audit. It's optional because for many reproductions the figure-comparison already settles "did it match?"; the sentence-by-sentence audit earns its keep when the paper makes many specific quantitative claims and the user wants each one anchored to a code location.

If yes, ask the user to run `/check-sentence-by-sentence` themselves — that skill is user-invoked by design and should not be launched from here. Same discipline as `/figure-comparison` once it runs: it can prompt the user, so it belongs in the main session, never under `Task` or inside a ralph iteration.

The audit renders directly in chat as a markdown report organized by paper section — the skill writes no files.

## Step 2: walk `open-questions.md` with the user

Read `open-questions.md` at the workdir root. For each unresolved entry, surface it via `AskUserQuestion` with:

- **The question** (verbatim from the file)
- **Origin** — which phase flagged it
- **The default the phase applied** (if any — e.g. "code as canonical")
- **Three options**: ratify the default, override (user spells out their choice), or defer (leave as a known limitation in the final report)

Append a `## Resolutions` section to `open-questions.md` capturing what the user said for each entry. This makes the resolution durable — re-runs and future sessions see it. Cross-reference with CLAUDE.md's **Paper-vs-code disagreements** section: every entry there should now have its resolution recorded, either inline (if the user picked the canonical default) or in `open-questions.md`.

If a resolution warrants a spec change (the user picks an override), edit `astra.yaml` / `implementation-notes.md` / `universes/baseline.yaml` accordingly and re-run `astra validate astra.yaml`. If the change would invalidate the comparison report (e.g. flips the canonical method for a primary output), surface that to the user — in most cases the reproduction is "done" and the override is a known limitation, but the user may choose to re-open the loop for another IMPLEMENT pass.

## Step 3: write `REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md`

A single markdown file at the project root, ~1–2 pages. The canonical record of what this reproduction landed on. Sections:

1. **What was reproduced** — the paper, the scope, the targets.
2. **Verdict** — pass / partial. If partial, what failed and why we accepted it.
3. **Material decisions** — the paper-vs-code conflicts SPECIFY's code pass (and any IMPLEMENT pass) surfaced, what the user chose (in prose ratification or by canonical-resolution default), and why.
4. **Outputs** — pointers to the figures / tables / metrics produced. One bullet per primary target with the path to the reproduced result and a one-line match note from the comparison report.
5. **Open opportunities** — pull from CLAUDE.md's *Open opportunities* list (already carries un-acted-on opportunities from the latest COMPARE), plus anything fresh in `comparison-report.yaml`'s `opportunities:` block not yet reflected there. One bullet each with the leverage assessment. This is what a future session (or a future-Cail revisiting) would tighten next.
6. **What was learned** — anything the reproduction surfaced that wasn't visible from the paper alone (a parameter the code uses but the paper doesn't mention, a data cut stricter than stated, etc.). The reproduction's value to the broader literature.
7. **Resolved open questions** — pull from `open-questions.md`'s `## Resolutions` section. One bullet per question + its resolution.
8. **Re-running** — one paragraph: how to re-run from this workdir (`lc run --universe baseline`, the relevant `astra.yaml`, where CLAUDE.md lives so future Claude Code sessions auto-load it on walk-up).

Brief, not exhaustive. The depth lives in `astra.yaml` and the workdir's notes; the summary is the door into them.

## Step 4: reconcile the Open opportunities list

COMPARE iterations have been logging un-acted-on opportunities into CLAUDE.md's *Open opportunities* list as they run, so the list is already populated. REVIEW's job here is reconciliation: cross-check that every opportunity in `comparison-report.yaml`'s `opportunities:` block that the user did NOT act on is present in CLAUDE.md's list, and remove any that the user acted on at REVIEW (e.g. authorized one more IMPLEMENT round to close).

## Step 5: commit

Stage `REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md`, `open-questions.md` (with resolutions), the updated CLAUDE.md, the final `astra.yaml`, the comparison artifacts, and any housekeeping changes. Commit with a message that names the verdict and the close-out:

```
review: <paper-short-name> verdict <verdict>, summary at REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md
```

This commit is the durable mark that the reproduction has reached close-out. Future walk-ups read CLAUDE.md and `git log` to know where the reproduction stands; the close-out commit + REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md together stand in for the old constitution `outcome:` field.

## Survey signals (entry into REVIEW)

- `comparison-report.yaml` verdict is `pass` (or `partial` with un-acted opportunities logged) ⇒ ready to close out
- `.lightcone/comparison.html` exists ⇒ `/figure-comparison` rendered
- `open-questions.md` has a `## Resolutions` section covering every entry ⇒ open-questions walkthrough done
- `REPRODUCTION-SUMMARY.md` exists ⇒ final report written
- CLAUDE.md's *Open opportunities* list reflects the un-acted-on opportunities from the latest COMPARE ⇒ reconciliation done
- A `review:` commit lands ⇒ REVIEW done; reproduction complete

## Notes

- **This phase runs in the user's main session.** Do not invoke it from inside a ralph iteration. The whole point of REVIEW is that the user is reachable — every step prompts the user (via `AskUserQuestion` directly, or via the interactive sibling skills it invokes), and iterations are detached.
- **`/figure-comparison` and `/check-sentence-by-sentence` are interactive.** They prompt the user when they need input — that's why REVIEW runs in the user's main session and they live here, not in any iteration. Invoking either inside an iteration fires prompts into nothing.
- **The user owns the verdict-acceptance decision.** REVIEW's purpose is to let the user see what the loop's iterations did and decide whether they accept it. The skill renders surfaces and asks; it does not unilaterally close.
- **Don't confuse with the per-phase reviews inside the loop.** ARCHITECT, SPECIFY, LITERATURE, and IMPLEMENT each have their own fresh-context review discipline that happens by iteration boundary. Those are unrelated to this close-out — same word, different jobs. The phase boundary makes them unambiguous: per-phase reviews live inside their host phase's reference; this one is the post-loop close-out in the user's main session.
- **Open-question resolutions are durable.** Append to `open-questions.md`'s `## Resolutions` section so the next re-run / future session sees what was decided. Do not delete the original questions.
- **Keep the report short.** Long reports get skimmed; short reports get read. Two pages is generous.
- **Do not invent further work.** If the user has accepted the verdict and the opportunities are propagated, the reproduction is done. The next session, the user, or a future revisit can decide whether tightening any open opportunity still serves them.
